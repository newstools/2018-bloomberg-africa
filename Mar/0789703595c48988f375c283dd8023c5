Kroger Co., the largest supermarket chain in the U.S., will remove publications about assault rifles from its stores, wading further into the U.S. debate on gun control. The move comes a few weeks after the grocer joined Walmart Inc. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. in tightening gun restrictions in the aftermath of the deadly school shooting last month in Parkland, Florida. Now, Kroger is pulling “a few assault-rifle themed periodicals” from its supermarkets, but will continue to carry some gun magazines, according to spokeswoman Kristal Howard. This week, students across the nation walked out of their classrooms in an act of solidarity with the Florida high school students. The Senate Judiciary Committee met on Wednesday to discuss gun control measures, though a formal bill debate has not yet been held on the floor. On March 24, gun control groups are planning the “March for Our Lives” in Washington. Kroger has stopped selling firearms and ammunition at its Fred Meyer chain to buyers under the age of 21. Walmart, which did the same, also removed toys that resemble assault-style weapons from their stores.
