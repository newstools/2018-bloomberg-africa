U.S. consumer confidence declined in March for the first time this year on tempered optimism about the outlook for the economy, according to figures Tuesday from the New York-based Conference Board. The softening in March reflected smaller shares of respondents who expect better business conditions, higher incomes and more job availability in the next six months. Fewer also said they anticipate stock prices will be higher in the year ahead. Even with the dip in sentiment, the share of consumers who said jobs are currently plentiful climbed to the highest level since April 2001. The biggest share of respondents since the end of 2000 said present business conditions are good. At the same time, there was also an uptick in those who said conditions were bad. The figures show moods remain fairly upbeat amid a strong labor market and bigger after-tax paychecks that have the potential to drive consumer spending. “Despite the modest retreat in confidence, index levels remain historically high and suggest further strong growth in the months ahead,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. — With assistance by Alexandre Tanzi
