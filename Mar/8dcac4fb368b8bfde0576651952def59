Sweden is playing host to North Korea’s top diplomat for talks that will sound out the possibility of holding a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Asian country’s leader Kim Jong Un. Discussions on Thursday and Friday between Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom and her North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, will focus on whether to hold a summit and any possible trust-building efforts that would be needed, a person familiar with the talks said. The visit comes after the U.S. president shocked most observers in saying he would agree to meet with his North Korean counterpart to solve the long-brewing nuclear stand off. Sweden has often played a special role for the U.S. in North Korea, acting as a so-called protecting power since it has an embassy. “If the main actors want Sweden to play a role, facilitate, be a forum or a link, or whatever it could be, then we are prepared,” Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said to news agency TT. Ri Yong Ho Officially, Sweden said the meeting will seek to discuss the UN Security Council’s condemnation of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and the need for deeper diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution. The visit “aims to contribute to the effective implementation of these resolutions,” the Swedish Foreign Ministry said. The ministry aims to publish a press release summarizing the talks after discussions have been finished, in the evening on March 16, the ministry said.
