Donald Trump has traded cheeseburgers for salads in the presidential diet -- at least some of the time. The president whose trademark campaign-trail dinner consisted of two McDonald’s Big Macs, two Filet-o-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate milkshake is cutting back on doctor’s orders to drop a few pounds, according to three people familiar with the matter. Less red meat, more fish. One person said it’s been two weeks since he saw the president eat a hamburger. Trump weighed in borderline obese at his first presidential physical in January and his doctor, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, advised him to eat less fat and carbohydrates and to exercise regularly. At 239 pounds and 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Trump measured just one pound below obese under guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s not just the president. Jackson and the vice president’s doctor are pushing healthy food choices throughout the West Wing. Trump so far has embraced the new regimen, giving aides the impression he feels he is thriving on his new diet, they said. Still, he is allowing himself indulgences. He ate bacon at breakfast one day this week.
