While there’s no majority view on how to position, some 40 percent of respondents in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of money managers expect lower global stocks as a consequence of escalating U.S. trade tensions. Another 19 percent chose a weaker greenback. Only 17 percent of those surveyed expected no increase in tensions. The investors, overseeing $354 billion of assets, were surveyed March 9-14.
