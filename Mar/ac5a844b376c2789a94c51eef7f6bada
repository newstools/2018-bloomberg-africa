Even if the U.K. gets a Canada-style trade arrangement, rather than a muted proposal for a so-called ‘Canada Plus Plus’ deal, the economic benefit of an agreement would far outweigh ‘no deal’ and a bumpy exit to a trading relationship set by World Trade Organisation rules, say Bloomberg Economics’ Dan Hanson and Jamie Murray. By 2030, the loss of output associated with a WTO regime -- discounted using the U.K. government’s standard schedule -- is more than 10 times the size of the cost of the Brexit bill, including the interest associated with paying it, according to their research. In other words, the Brexit bill would pay for itself quickly.
