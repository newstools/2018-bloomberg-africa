Naspers Ltd. plans to sell $10.6 billion worth of shares in Tencent Holdings Ltd., equivalent to 2 percent of the technology giant’s issued stock, to fund investments in other parts of its business. The sale of 190 million shares will cut the stake held by Naspers to 31.2 percent, the Cape Town-based company said in a statement on Thursday. It’s the first time Naspers has reduced its holdings in Tencent since investing in the company in 2011. “The funds will be used to reinforce Naspers’ balance sheet and will be invested over time to accelerate the growth of our classifieds, online food delivery and fintech businesses globally and to pursue other exciting growth opportunities when they arise,” Naspers said. Naspers Chief Executive Officer Bob Van Dijk has been trying to reduce the gap between its stake in Tencent and the value of Africa’s largest company. Naspers gained 1.7 percent by 11:04 a.m. in Johannesburg, while Tencent declined 5 percent in Hong Kong.
