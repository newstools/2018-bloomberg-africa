New Jersey Transit won’t have to raise fares next year thanks to additional funding in the state budget, Governor Phil Murphy said. “My expectation is that you’ll treat these public dollars as if they’re your own,” Murphy, 60, said Wednesday at the cash-strapped agency’s regular board meeting in Newark. It was the first time a sitting governor has addressed NJ Transit’s board at a public meeting. The Democrat, who took office Jan. 16, proposed a record $37.4 billion budget on Tuesday that would raise taxes on retail sales and millionaires to help boost spending on schools, pensions and mass transit. His proposal would almost triple the direct state subsidy for NJ Transit, which has been plagued by safety and financial issues. Including funding for the agency from the state’s Turnpike Authority and an energy fund, he boosts money for NJ Transit by about a third. Murphy told the board it needs to evaluate agency staff members hired for their patronage connections to former Republican Governor Chris Christie, not their experience. He also urged the board to use money to make repairs and upgrades to help New York City commuters who have been dealing with delays and overcrowding. People considering jobs in the New Jersey-New York area “will look elsewhere” without improvements, Murphy said.
