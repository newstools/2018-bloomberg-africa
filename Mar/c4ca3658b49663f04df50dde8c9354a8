Norway’s Justice Minister Sylvi Listhaug resigned to avert a government crisis ahead of a no-confidence vote in parliament. The minister announced her decision on Facebook early Tuesday after a majority in parliament had signaled they would oust her in a process scheduled to start at 10 a.m. She had angered the opposition after accusing the Labor Party of caring more for the rights of terrorists than national security. Listhaug said she was the victim of a “witch hunt” by labor party leader Jonas Gahr Store who’s aim was to limit the freedom of speech when it comes to discussing immigration. She said she will continue her fight in parliament for a strict immigration policy. Read more on crisis here
