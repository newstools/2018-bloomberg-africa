A Russian citizen accused of hacking LinkedIn and Dropbox in 2012 appeared in a U.S. courtroom and was ordered to undergo a medical evaluation after being extradited from the Czech Republic in a move that may increase diplomatic tensions between Washington and Moscow. Yevgeniy Nikulin, who’s repeatedly denied the hacking allegations, “has a number of medical issues and is hoping to go to the hospital,” his public defender told a federal judge in San Francisco at a hearing Friday. Russia sought Nikulin on separate charges, but the Czech Republic elected to send him to the U.S. after rejecting his request for asylum, according to Czech Radio. Russia is “deeply disappointed” by the Czech decision, which was taken “without considering all the factors and circumstances of this case,” the Tass news service reported, citing the Russian embassy in Prague. Czech Justice Minister Robert Pelikan said earlier that President Milos Zeman, an ardent supporter of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, had repeatedly asked him to extradite Nikulin to Moscow. The extradition comes amid U.S. investigations into alleged Russian cyber attacks and interference in the 2016 presidential election campaign won by Donald Trump. Russia denies meddling in the campaign. Nikulin was indicted in California on multiple counts of computer-enabled fraud and identity theft. Czech police detained him in October 2016 after being alerted by a so-called Red Notice from Interpol.
