The Financial Conduct Authority started a new chapter in the debate over corporate culture, moving beyond financial misconduct and focusing on how bankers act outside the boardroom. In a report on "Transforming Culture in Financial Services" published on Tuesday, the regulator said it wants to "ask the provocative questions, encourage discussion, strengthen current consensus, and speed up the pace of change for cultural transformation in financial services." The conduct of bankers returned to the spotlight in January, when an investigation into an all-male charity gala at the Presidents Club by the Financial Times described how many of the event’s 130 hostesses were “groped, sexually harassed and propositioned” after being ordered to wear skimpy outfits and matching underwear. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, FCA Chief Executive Officer Andrew Bailey said the responsibility of improving "disappointing" phenomena of the finance industry like the low levels of diversity and the gender-pay gap lay with the banks. “Individuals can’t change institutions on their own,” Bailey said. “Big institutions have a responsibility to set the tone." The club closed within a day of the article being published after a public outcry, with Prime Minister Theresa May saying she was “frankly appalled" by the report.
