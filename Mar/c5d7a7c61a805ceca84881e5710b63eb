The jobless rate dropped to a record low of 5.3 percent in March, the Federal Labor Agency in Nuremberg said on Thursday.

While sentiment indicators have recently taken a hit amid mounting fears over U.S. protectionism, the high volume of orders accumulated in the second half of last year is likely to support manufacturing activity for now, according to the central bank. Fading optimism may have some effects “here and there, but we don’t see it as a trend reversal,” Detlef Scheele, head of the federal labor agency, said at a press conference in Nuremberg. One risk facing some sectors is that the country’s increasingly tight labor market will limit companies’ ability to hire staff to sustain growth. Construction is seeing “considerable capacity bottlenecks,” according to the Bundesbank, and one in four businesses cite labor shortages as a reason for holding back production, EU data show.
