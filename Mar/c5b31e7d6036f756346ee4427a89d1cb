The chef who built a menu out of emojis has done it again. Bangkok’s Gaggan restaurant has just topped the list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants for a fourth consecutive year. The Indian eatery, renowned for its 25-course tasting  menu illustrated only with emoji symbols, eclipsed stiff competition from Tokyo’s Den and Florilege, which took second and third spots respectively. The winners were announced at a ceremony at Wynn Palace in Macau. The list is chosen by a panel of more than 300 food writers, critics, chefs and restaurateurs spanning six geographical regions. Each expert picks 10 restaurants and lists them in order of preference. They must have eaten at every restaurant on their list within the previous 18 months. Rounding out the top five were Suhring in Bangkok and Odette in Singapore. After his win last year Gaggan Anand shocked the foodie world by announcing that he would shut down his award-winning restaurant in 2020. He told Bloomberg that he planned to move to Japan and open several new restaurants, drawing on Buddhist principles. “Every restaurant has a 10-year life,” he said at the time. “After that, it becomes a brand.” Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants is published by William Reed Business Media. The World’s 50 Best will be revealed at a ceremony in Bilbao, Spain, in June. The Winners
