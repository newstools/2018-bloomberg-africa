Lowe’s Cos., under pressure to match the performance of Home Depot Inc., is looking for new leadership after its long-time chairman and chief executive officer announced plans to retire. Robert Niblock, a 25-year veteran of the home-improvement retailer, will remain with the company in his current roles until a successor is found, the company said Monday. He has served as CEO for 13 years. Lowe’s shares jumped as much as 6.7 percent in early trading after the announcement. Robert Niblock Niblock, 55, is stepping down while activist investor D.E. Shaw & Co. has pushed Lowe’s to close the gap with Home Depot Inc. While sales at Lowe’s have risen, they continue to trail gains at its larger competitor as property values rise and Americans invest more in their homes. “The market is likely excited for new leadership,” said Seema Shah, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It is hoping for a leader who can better capitalize on the macro tailwinds and drive improved bottom-line performance.” Part of Lowe’s struggle is the chain has fewer stores in lucrative areas than Home Depot. Niblock said last month that the company is boosting capital spending by about 50 percent this year, and working to have employees spend more time with customers. Shares of Lowe’s surged as high as $89.40 in premarket trading. They had dropped as much as 9.9 percent this year through Friday’s close.
