Melrose Industries Plc raised its hostile bid for GKN Plc by 9 percent in a last-ditch attempt to woo shareholders to its buyout proposal and reject a competing plan by the U.K. engineering firm to break itself up. The new, final offer of 467 pence a share is valued at 8.1 billion pounds ($11 billion), Birmingham-based Melrose said in an open letter to GKN shareholders Monday. While the shares advanced as much as 2.7 percent, GKN said its own proposal is worth more than 500 pence. It said Monday it will study the new offer. Investors have until March 29 to decide whether to take the cash-and-stock offer that would hand Melrose the task of turning around the struggling business, or stick with GKN’s plan to sell off its automotive unit and focus on aerospace. Last week, GKN agreed to combine the driveline business to U.S.-based Dana Inc. in a $6.1 billion transaction aimed at repelling its suitor. Melrose called that plan a “hasty fire-sale” and a “bad deal.” Many investors won’t be able to hold the shares being offered as part of the automotive deal, it said. “We have recently made attempts to engage in constructive discussion with the GKN board with a view to agreeing the terms of a recommended offer,” Melrose said in the letter. “Your board has unequivocally declined each time to enter into any such discussions.” GKN rose 1.8 percent to 443 pence at 8:24 a.m. in London, after earlier reaching 446.9 pence. Melrose dropped 0.9 percent to 222.8 pence. The aerospace business has attracted a number of approaches at values “significantly’ above what is reflected in the current share price, GKN said in its appeal to investors. It’s not following up on any proposals because management remains focused on turning the business around, it said. The Dana deal would leave GKN investors owning 47.25 percent of the enlarged automotive business.
