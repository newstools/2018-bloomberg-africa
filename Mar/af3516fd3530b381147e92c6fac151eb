Trading of Blue Sky Alternative Investments Ltd. shares have been halted after short-seller Glaucus Research Group questioned the company’s assets under management in a report. Shares dropped as much as 16 percent to A$9.61 before the halt, the most since August 2016, after Glaucus said it had a short position in the Brisbane-based fund manager and valued the stock at A$2.66 at most. Glaucus alleged that Blue Sky’s fee-earning assets under management were an estimated 63 percent less than the reported figure, according to the report.
