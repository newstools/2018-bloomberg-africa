Bank of America Merrill Lynch reckons the Australian dollar will rise to 77 U.S. cents by the end of the year driven by higher local interest rates. Goldman Sachs Asset Management says the currency is heading south as rates stay on hold. The diverging views come as the Aussie has sunk to a ten-month low, pummeled by a rallying greenback. Swap traders are pricing in a one in three chance of a rate increase in Australia at the December meeting, while the Federal Reserve is committed to lifting borrowing costs. The Reserve Bank of Australia kept rates at a record low 1.5 percent for the 19th straight meeting on Tuesday as employment growth moderates and inflation lingers near the bottom of the central bank’s 2 percent to 3 percent target. The currency fell to 74.73 U.S. cents on Tuesday, its weakest since June. It was trading at 74.91 U.S. cents on Wednesday. The Australian dollar is forecast to trade at about 79 U.S. cents by the fourth quarter of this year, according to a survey by Bloomberg.
