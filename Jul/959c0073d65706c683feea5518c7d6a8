Whether you regard your next flight as a chance to kick back and relax or a valuable window to catch up on lost work may depend on where you live, according to a survey of 8,000 passengers in 10 key travel markets.

Indian, Chinese and Arab passengers, by contrast, are generally keen to make calls. Some 69 percent of Germans reckon it’s not necessary to be permanently available, compared to just 12 percent of Indians and 18 percent of Chinese, according to the survey.

Fewer than one-third of respondents in any country wanted a shower, spa, wellness service or fitness equipment on board. Generously sized seating is regarded as a priority on long-haul flights, especially for Americans, with 59 percent of U.S. respondents ranking bottom space and legroom as very important. Better seating is also the single-biggest priority for people when considering the future of air travel, the poll suggests.
