Uganda is reviewing a daily tax levied on users of social-media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, as well as tariffs on mobile-money transactions. The government of East Africa’s third-biggest economy has “noted public concerns” and will hold further discussions on the topic, Prime Minister Ruhakana Ruganda told lawmakers Wednesday, according to his speech on the website of the state-run Uganda Media Centre. The “government is now reviewing the taxes taking into consideration the concerns of the public and its implications on the budget,” he said. A daily levy of 200 shillings, or 5 U.S. cents, and a 1 percent tax on all mobile-phone transactions came into force July 1 as the country tries to widen its tax base. The measure attracted criticism from Ugandans and human-rights advocates. “The review is being expedited to ensure that government presents” an amended Excise Duty Act for parliamentary debate on July 19, he said.
