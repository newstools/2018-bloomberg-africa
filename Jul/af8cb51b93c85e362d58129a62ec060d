DP World Ltd. plans to develop a logistics hub in Mali, the latest push by the Dubai-based port operator to expand its operations in Africa. DP World signed a 20-year concession with Mali to build and operate a 1,000-hectare logistics hub outside of Bamako, the capital and largest city of the country, according to a statement. The Mali Logistics Hub will have inland container depots and container freight stations that will facilitate the import and export of goods. In Africa, DP World operates ports in Algeria, Somaliland, Rwanda, Mozambique, Djibouti and Senegal. It has a portfolio of 78 marine and inland terminals across six continents, according to information on its website.
