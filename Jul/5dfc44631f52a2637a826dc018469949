Asian stocks began the week in the red as investors questioned earnings results against lofty expectations and prepared for key policy meetings from the world’s biggest central banks. The onshore yuan added to last week’s slump, driven in part by China’s moves to ease monetary conditions. Equities in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney fell, as did shares in Hong Kong and China.
