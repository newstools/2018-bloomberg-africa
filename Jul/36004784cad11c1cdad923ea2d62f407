Mark Zuckerberg is paying the price for Facebook Inc.â€™s disappointing earnings report. His fortune tumbled by $15 billion as of 9:35 a.m. on Thursday, erasing his gains for the year, leaving him with about $71 billion. If the decline holds through the close, he will likely slide to sixth place from third place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
