Emerging-market currencies rose for the first week in six as the U.S. dollar retreated on softer-than-expected wage data and escalating trade tensions. Equities trimmed their fourth week of declines. The MSCI Emerging-Market Currency Index gained less than 0.1 percent while the gauge tracking the developing-market stocks slipped 0.8 percent. The Bloomberg Barclays index of EM local-currency government bonds was little changed.
