Electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc. no longer has the road to itself. German carmakers Daimler AG, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG are closing in and may pass their American rival by 2021, based on a consultancy’s ranking of electric automakers that factors strategy, battery technology, culture, supplier networks, partnerships and financial performance into an overall score. Daimler is poised to overtake Tesla in scorecard ranking electric automakers Source: PA Consulting  Tesla will remain No. 1 in 2019, according to the forecast by PA Consulting Group. But by 2021, when traditional rivals flood the road with a variety of models, Elon Musk’s company will fall to seventh place. By then, Daimler will be in the lead, followed by BMW, the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi alliance and VW.
