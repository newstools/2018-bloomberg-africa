The committee is formed of chairman and former BP Plc Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward, as well as non-executive directors Patrice Merrin and Leonhard Fischer, Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore said in a statement Wednesday. Glencore last week said the Department of Justice demanded documents relating to possible corruption and money laundering regarding its business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela over the past decade.
