U.S. President Donald Trump declined to brand his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as friend or foe ahead of the first full-fledged one-on-one summit between the two in Helsinki next week. "I really can’t say right now. As far as I’m concerned, he’s a competitor," Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for a European tour that will also include potentially tense meetings with leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and his first visit to the U.K. as president. Donald Trump on July 10. Amid criticism that the president has been harsher toward the U.S.’s NATO allies than toward the Kremlin -- even in the face of evidence of attempted Russian election meddling -- Trump defended his stance toward Moscow. "I think that getting along with Russia, getting along with China, and getting along with others is a good thing," he said Tuesday. "It’s not a bad thing." After viewing Trump’s comments, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he feared that Trump would say "da" to whatever Putin wants. "I’m really worried about the president sitting alone in a room with Putin," Schumer said in an interview on MSNBC. Trump told the assembled journalists that meeting with Putin may be the "easiest" leg of his trip and reiterated his demand that NATO countries shoulder a larger share of the alliance’s budget. He also observed that the U.K. -- and its embattled Prime Minister Theresa May -- was in “somewhat turmoil” and was noticeably less effusive about May than he was about Boris Johnson, who resigned Monday over opposition to May’s plans to leave the European Union.
