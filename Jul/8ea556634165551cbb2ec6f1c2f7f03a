Suddenly, diversity is in again for the oil business. Explorers with a hand in multiple fronts -- from onshore to deepwater, pumping crude to refining it -- are trading at a premium to pure-play U.S. shale drillers, analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. said in a report Tuesday. After a mid-decade crash in American shale fields and a rebound in international crude prices, “diversified independents" like ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp. are back in favor, the researchers said. That’s a turnaround from recent years, when investors smiled on companies that doubled down on “unconventional" drilling in the U.S. while shedding assets elsewhere.

The opportunity may be fleeting. Big share buybacks have propelled the stocks this year, but it’s unclear how sustainable they’ll be, the analysts wrote. And the pool of diversified players is likely to shrink with consolidation “an ever-present threat, both within the peer group and from larger predators," WoodMac said.
