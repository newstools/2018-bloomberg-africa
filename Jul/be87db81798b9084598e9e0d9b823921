Sierra Leonean President Julius Maada Bio ordered the creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate graft and the immediate audit of at least two banks amid a surge of corruption allegations against the previous government. The anti-corruption commission will be headed by two judges whose names will be made public shortly, according to a statement from the presidency dated July 9. The government will instruct the state-owned Sierra Leone Commercial Bank Ltd. and closely held Rokel Commercial Bank Ltd. to recover unpaid loans owed by politically and financially exposed persons within 30 days, it said in the statement. The announcement follows a report released last week that alleges widespread corruption in the government of ex-President Ernest Bai Koroma, who stepped down this year after two terms in office. Koroma, who himself has been accused of fraudulent practices in the report, has dismissed the allegations as baseless and says that the ruling Sierra Leone Peopleâ€™s Party is conducting a smear campaign. In May, police arrested ex-Vice President Victor Foh and former minister of mines Minkailu Mansaray on allegations of misuse of public funds. They have been released on bail. Maada Bio, who briefly ruled the West African nation as head of a junta during the civil war in the 1990s and pledged to tackle corruption as he campaigned for elections earlier this year, assumed office in April.
