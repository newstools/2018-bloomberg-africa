Barcelona is providing the world with images of political tension and tribal conflict. Again. Fourteen months after capital of Spain’s Catalonia region grabbed the world’s attention during the failed attempt to declare independence, pro-separatism protesters clashed with police. It came just as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was holding a cabinet meeting there as part of his policy to repair relations with the Catalan public. Riot police clash with protesters on Paralelo Avenue on Dec. 21 Much of the focus on Friday is on the self-described Committees for the Defense of the Republic, groups who spearheaded the protests, shutting down more than 20 highways through Catalonia and exhorting their supporters to try to trap ministers in the 14th-century mansion where they were meeting. Protests began early on Friday with campaigners blocking about 20 roads As Sanchez’s cabinet met to approve decisions including increases to the minimum wage and investment in Catalan highways, hooded protesters tossed fences in scuffles with police. A few threw yellow and red paint at security forces, cheering when cops where hit and stained with the colors of the nationalist flag.
