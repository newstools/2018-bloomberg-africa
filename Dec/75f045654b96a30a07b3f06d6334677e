Today in Brexit: What will the New Year bring? No one really knows, but that won’t stop us trying to make sense of it all. It’s end-of-term day in Westminster. Despite pleas from some in the House of Commons to keep Parliament in session given the Brexit crisis, lawmakers head home for the holidays knowing that the biggest decision has been deferred until the new year. MPs will vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal the week beginning Jan. 14. With the denouement deferred, here are five Brexit scenarios that could play out in 2019. Whatever happens, it’s going right down to the wire. If you like Bloomberg’s Brexit coverage, why not subscribe?
