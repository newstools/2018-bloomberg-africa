Japan’s key price indicator slipped in March after hitting 1 percent in February, yet the underlying trend is seen remaining intact as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda begins his second term vowing to achieve 2 percent inflation. The Bank of Japan had been making progress in generating inflation, with domestic demand picking up, although the yen’s rise has complicated the outlook. This month Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was confident the target would be reached next year, at which point the BOJ would start considering how to normalize monetary policy over the rest of his term.
