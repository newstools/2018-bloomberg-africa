Axis Bank Ltd.’s Chief Executive Officer Shikha Sharma will step down at the end of 2018, more than two years before the proposed end of her term, amid reports the regulator is questioning the lender’s performance. The board of India’s third-largest private bank had proposed she stay through 2021 but accepted Sharma’s request for an exit on Dec. 31, 2018, Axis Bank said in a statement late Monday in Mumbai. Sharma has been Axis Bank’s CEO since 2009. The Reserve Bank of India had written to Axis Bank’s board to reconsider the three-year extension proposed for Sharma due to the bank’s performance and deteriorating asset quality, the Economic Times had reported April 2, citing people it didn’t identify. In the year ended March 2017, an RBI audit showed Axis hadn’t disclosed bad loans worth about 56 billion rupees ($861 million). Its shares have risen 1.7 percent over the past year compared with the 15 percent gain in the 10-member Bankex index. India’s banks are being roiled by news of frauds and alleged conflicts of interest. The board of ICICI Bank Ltd. is said to be divided over whether to ask its CEO Chanda Kochhar to step down as federal authorities investigate allegations of impropriety over loans made to Videocon group.
