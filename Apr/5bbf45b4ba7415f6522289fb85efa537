High-ranking countries share some key characteristics: good education systems, conducive regulatory and business landscapes, employment policies that favor flexibility as well as openness, the report said. This year’s study focused on the importance of diversity and inclusion within organizations to boost competitiveness.

Globally, European countries continued to dominate the ranking with eight countries featuring in the top 10. The U.S. clocked in at third place.
