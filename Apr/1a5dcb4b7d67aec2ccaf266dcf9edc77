For investors and analysts watching Chinese President Xi Jinping’s landmark economic speech Tuesday, the mood was one of relief. Asian stocks and U.S. futures jumped in Asian morning trading as Xi called for an upholding of the multilateral trade system and said dialogue was the way to resolve disputes, diffusing trade tensions with the U.S. In his keynote address to the Boao Forum for Asia, Xi vowed to open sectors of China’s economy from banking to auto manufacturing, increase imports and expand protection to intellectual property. “There’s no direct confrontation” with the U.S., said Peter So, co-head of research at CCB International Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. This suggests “possible room for improvement over the trade dispute.” Japan’s Topix index climbed as much 1 percent after Xi started speaking, while S&P 500 Index futures jumped as much as 1.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rallied 1.1 percent. Here are some other investor reactions: “If the leader of China can take a long-term view, I think that is ultimately a big market positive,” said Sunny Bangia, Deputy Portfolio Manager at Antipodes Partners Ltd. in Sydney. “Stability of government can create policy stability, long-term solution-focused government and less” noise. “Obviously, the Chinese leader has the difficult task of balancing the defense of Chinese interests and championing free trade,” said Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. “That being said, early comments leaned towards the opening of the Chinese economy and that appears to have been taken rather positively.”
