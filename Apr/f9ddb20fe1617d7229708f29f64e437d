Libya’s eastern military leader, Khalifa Haftar, returned home on Thursday after medical treatment in France -- an absence that raised the prospect of renewed turmoil in the OPEC member country. Haftar, who controls the self-styled Libyan National Army, is the main power broker in the eastern region that’s home to much of the oil infrastructure. With the LNA, Haftar wrested control of the east from militant movements, including Islamic State, and helped in the resumption of crude exports after disruptions hit Libya’s revenues. Haftar returned to Benghazi, the country’s second largest city, to a hero’s welcome. Television footage showed him stepping off the plane unassisted and greeting officials gathered to witness his arrival. Touted Successor to Libya’s Haftar Escapes Assassination Attempt The field marshal who served with former Libyan leader Moammar Al Qaddafi, assisting the then-military officer in overthrowing King Idris in 1969, has been touted by his supporters as the best qualified to serve as president of a nation that has seen little but instability and violence since 2011. His detractors decry what they say are Haftar’s dictatorial tendencies and he has not been able to impose his influence in the capital. Haftar, 75, is one of the main forces opposing the internationally backed government in Tripoli. His influence in the east, and the backing of the LNA, has placed him in a position to wield tremendous control over the country’s vast oil wealth, as well as influencing the fate of a United Nations-backed plan to restore order. Reports of his ill health began to emerge more than two weeks ago, with rumors spreading online that he was seriously ill, incapacitated or even dead. He arrived in Benghazi via Cairo. — With assistance by Saleh Sarrar, and Tarek El-Tablawy
