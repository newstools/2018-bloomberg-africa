Australia’s consumer prices rose slightly less than forecast last quarter, suggesting the central bank is likely to keep interest rates on hold.

Policy makers are banking on a record-low cash rate to boost hiring and tighten the labor market, which should in time spur wage growth and inflation. Traders are pricing in only about a one-in-three chance of the RBA tightening at the end of this year.
