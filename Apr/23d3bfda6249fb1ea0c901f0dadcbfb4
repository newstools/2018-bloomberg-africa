Zambia said it partially lifted a ban on processed meat and diary products from South Africa that were linked to the world’s worst outbreak of listeriosis. Tests of at-risk foods from South African manufacturers did not reveal the presence of the bacteria that caused the deadly outbreak, or listeria monocytogenes, Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya said in a statement Tuesday. The import ban will continue to apply on at-risk foods from Enterprise Foods Ltd., a unit of Tiger Brands Ltd., and RCL Foods Ltd.’s Rainbow brand, he said.
