U.S. filings for unemployment benefits fell to a
three-week low, continuing a trend that indicates a tight labor
market, Labor Department figures showed Thursday.       A widespread shortage of qualified workers is prompting
employers to retain staff, keeping claims near the lowest level
in 45 years. While the week-to-week numbers can be volatile,
benefits applications below 300,000 are considered consistent
with a healthy labor market. The latest results may get extra scrutiny from economists
because they cover the week including the 12th of the month, the
Labor Department's reference period for its monthly employment
report. Recent reports show the job market remains robust, with the
unemployment rate staying near the lowest since late 2000,
though worker pay has yet to develop a sustained acceleration.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report Wednesday said that
while companies were struggling to fill open jobs, wage growth
was modest.     â€” With assistance by Jordan Yadoo
