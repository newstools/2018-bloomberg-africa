Here’s some good news for New York City apartment-hunters: Manhattan rents dropped 3.8 percent in March from a year earlier, the most since 2011. The news is even better for tenants looking in Brooklyn and northwest Queens. Rents dropped 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent respectively, and landlords offered so many move-in incentives that they set records for giveaways, according to reports Thursday by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate. “For the renter, it’s a pretty good time to jump in,” said Hal Gavzie, Douglas Elliman’s executive manager of leasing. “For the landlords, it’s a little stressful.” Property owners across the three boroughs are contending with an avalanche of new apartment supply, giving them no choice but to cut prices. They’re stepping up discounts in the name of attracting renters, who are hunting as much for the best deal as they are for a place to live. And that’s not a bad thing for the market, Gavzie said. “This is what has to happen,” he said. “It will help absorb quite a bit and will do the adjustment and reset that’s needed.” Here’s what the rental market looked like across the three boroughs last month: What tenants paid to lease a Manhattan apartment fell by the most since 2011 Source: Miller Samuel Inc. and Douglas Elliman Real Estate  The cost of leasing an apartment in the borough dropped for a fourth straight month Source: Miller Samuel Inc. and Douglas Elliman Real Estate  The deals just keep getting sweeter in the borough's northwest neighborhoods Source: Miller Samuel Inc. and Douglas Elliman Real Estate
