Czech billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he will try to resume government talks with Social Democrats, snubbing a recommendation from the country’s president that he should seek backing from two extremist parties. The leadership of Babis’s ANO party decided to approach the Social Democrats again, he said on Twitter late on Thursday. The previous talks between the two groups collapsed last week over disagreement about the division of cabinet posts. President Milos Zeman advised Babis earlier this week to negotiate a tacit support for his minority cabinet with the Communists and the far-right SPD party.

The anti-Muslim SPD also calls for the Czech Republic to leave the European Union. Babis, the second-richest Czech, is now ruling in a caretaker role after his first single-party administration failed to win parliamentary approval in a confidence vote in January. In the first round of talks with the Social Democrats, he rejected their demand that he either stay out of the cabinet, because of an investigation of an alleged fraud at one of his businesses, or cede control of the Interior Ministry.
