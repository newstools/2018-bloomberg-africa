London Stock Exchange Group Plc hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Schwimmer to run the 217-year-old bourse, ending a months-long search. David Schwimmer He will join the group on Aug. 1 after a 20-year career at Goldman Sachs, the exchange said in a statement on Friday. He takes up one of the most high-profile jobs in the City of London. Schwimmer replaces interim CEO David Warren, who will retain his role as chief financial officer. The appointment ends a months-long search for the LSE after Xavier Rolet abruptly left last year following an ignominious public spat between activist shareholder TCI Fund Management and LSE’s board. Schwimmer has big boots to fill after Rolet, who became CEO in May 2009, led an almost sixfold rise in the stock price and made LSE the world’s largest clearinghouse. Clearing has become a political battleground in the wake of the U.K.’s Brexit decision and one of the first tasks for the new chief will be to defend LSE’s clearing business as rivals like Deutsche Boerse AG attempt to arrest its dominant position.
