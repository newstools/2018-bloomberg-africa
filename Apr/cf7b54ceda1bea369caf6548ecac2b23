PSA Group will increase production of compact vans at a plant near London that already makes vehicles under the Vauxhall brand, as the French carmaker tries to revive the U.K. company it acquired last year. PSA will raise capacity to 100,000 vehicles annually after reaching an agreement with U.K. unions, the company said in an emailed statement Wednesday. The plant produced 60,000 Opel-Vauxhall Vivaro models last year. The manufacturer plans to end a venture at the Luton site between the Vauxhall brand and French rival Renault SA, using the capacity for its own output, according to a spokesman. The venture produces Vauxhall’s Vivaro medium-sized vans on the same platform as Renault makes its Trafic vehicles. The planned exit of the U.K. from the European Union puts an increased focus on competitiveness at PSA’s factories in the country, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares  told Bloomberg last year. He’s in Luton for the announcement. PSA purchased the Opel and Vauxhall marques last year from General Motors Co. for about 2.2 billion euros ($2.7 billion). Vauxhall also operates a factory in Ellesmere Port, England, that makes the Astra hatchback and station wagon. Tavares has pledged to turn around the operations of the automaker, which has been building largely identical cars to models designed by Germany-based Opel. Increased production at Luton would be a boon for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May amid concern that manufacturers may cut jobs and move production out of the country as it leaves the EU. Tariffs and other hurdles to trade after Brexit could crimp auto output since parts routinely move across borders several times during the manufacturing process.
