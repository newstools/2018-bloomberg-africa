Fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies returned to haunt markets on Wednesday, sending U.S. stock futures tumbling and sinking European and Asian equities. Treasuries nudged higher, the dollar slipped and gold jumped. Hopes that Tuesday’s gains in U.S. equity markets would lead to a more lasting rebound appeared to founder as contracts for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow all slumped alongside both the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. China said it would levy 25 percent tariffs on imports of 106 U.S. products including soybeans, automobiles, chemicals and aircraft, in response to proposed American duties on its high-tech goods. Safe-haven assets including gold and the Japanese yen rallied, while European bonds gradually turned higher. Terminal users can follow the escalating trade tensions in our live blog. Markets have been buffeted in recent weeks by everything from a volatility spike and a tech selloff to fears of an all-out trade war, and developments on Wednesday suggest there may be more turbulence to come.

Sentiment is quite negative and the one thing that could change this is some sort of signal from central banks that they are willing to adapt their hawkish tone.” Elsewhere, West Texas oil fell as commodities were roiled by the growing trade dispute. Inflation data from Europe matched estimates, and the euro stayed higher. Emerging-market stocks tumbled and their currencies dropped.
