Shares of Snap Inc. fell Thursday after Snapchat was caught up in public backlash when an act of vandalism temporarily relabeled New York City as “Jewtropolis” on several popular apps and services. Snap fell as much as 2.6 percent, extending a three-day losing streak that has the shares trading at their lowest levels since May. The company earlier told the New York Times that the third-party data it uses for its map tools had been “subject to vandalism.”
