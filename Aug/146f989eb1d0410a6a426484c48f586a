Turkey’s lira ended a three-day rally and slid as much as 8 percent, underscoring the fragility of emerging-market sentiment. Gauges of stocks and currencies headed for a third week of declines amid growing risks from the U.S.-China trade war, Turkey’s policy response and volatile commodity prices. Emerging-market equities held just above a bear-market threshold and exchange rates hovered near a 13-month low as investors question whether policy makers were doing enough to ring-fence their economies from the impact of higher U.S. interest rates and the end of ultra-cheap capital.

Its currency counterpart slipped 0.1 percent, with the focal point of the sell-off shifting to South Africa’s rand. Bond-risk premiums jumped for a third week.
