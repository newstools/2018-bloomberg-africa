The pound slipped to the lowest level against the euro in almost nine months amid growing concern that the U.K. could end up leaving the European Union with no agreement for future economic ties. Sterling dropped for the third day versus Europe’s common currency and weakened against most of its Group-of-10 peers. U.K. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said over the weekend that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had increased to as much as 60 percent.

Against the dollar, it was little changed at $1.2934, not far from an eleven-month low of $1.2920 reached Monday. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds was steady at 1.33 percent.
