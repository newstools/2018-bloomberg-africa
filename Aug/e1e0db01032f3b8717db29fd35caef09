Mali President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita secured a second five-year term in office after beating former Finance Minister Soumaila Cisse in the Aug. 12 runoff election. Keita secured 67 percent of the vote against Cisse’s 33 percent, Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization Mohamed Ag Erlaf said in a broadcast on state television, ORTM. Turnout was 35 percent of the more than 8 million registered voters, according to Ag Erlaf. The 73-year-old Keita, popularly known as IBK, is facing expectations to stem corruption and reverse the spread of Islamist militancy in a country that’s in the front-line of a regional war against jihadists. Mali is the third-biggest gold producer in sub-Saharan Africa and the continent’s largest cotton grower. While the poll proceeded mostly peacefully, the outcome is marred by allegations of voting fraud and isolated attacks on ballot stations where the country is battling militants. About 490 of the approximately 23,000 polling stations never opened, of which 440 were in the Mopti region in central Mali, which has been among the hardest hit by the violence.
