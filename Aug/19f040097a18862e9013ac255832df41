Kenyan motorists plan to blockade the streets of the capital on Wednesday to protest a proposed tax on fuel. The Motorist Association of Kenya, a private group based in Nairobi that represents automobile owners, urged drivers to leave their vehicles parked on the road between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a statement published on its Twitter account. Kenya proposed a 16 percent tax on fuel in 2013, but lawmakers have repeatedly delayed its implementation. The levy is set to come into effect on Sept. 1, unless lawmakers postpone it again, potentially raising the cost of a liter of gasoline by 18 shillings (18 U.S. cents) per liter (0.26 gallons).
