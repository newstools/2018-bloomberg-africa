Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former governor of Nigeria’s northern state of Kano, will seek to oust President Muhammadu Buhari in elections scheduled for February. Kwankwaso, who’s now a senator, will announce on Aug. 29 that he will compete to become the presidential candidate for the main opposition People’s Democratic Party, which will hold primaries later this year, his spokeswoman, Binta Spikin, said by phone Sunday. The 61-year-old was among several lawmakers who defected from Buhari’s All Progressives Congress in July. Other prominent figures have also said they may bid for the PDP’s presidential ticket, including former vice-president Atiku Abubakar and Bukola Saraki, the head of the senate.
