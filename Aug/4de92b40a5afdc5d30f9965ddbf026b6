Burberry has changed its logo for the first time in 20 years, revealing the new look via an Instagram post. The British heritage brand’s new logo says “Burberry London England” in stark capital letters, replacing the softer, rounder font the company previously used. Riccardo Tisci, the star designer Burberry hired this year to revamp its brand image, posted screen shots of an exchange with graphic designer Peter Saville agreeing on the logo. Designer Riccardo Tisci unveils stark new logo for Burberry Plc Saville is known for iconic album covers for bands like Joy Division and work for fashion brands including the most recent logo for PVH Corp.’s Calvin Klein and ready-to-wear collaborations with Puig’s Paco Rabanne. Burberry also revealed a new monogram print featuring interlocking T’s and B’s -- for the brand’s founder, Thomas Burberry. A wave of customer nostalgia for the logo prints of the 1990s and early 2000s has led brands including Kering SA’s Gucci and LVMH’s Fendi and Christian Dior divisions to revive their monogrammed accessory lines, which many luxury labels had discontinued to prevent overexposure.

Tisci, who will show his first runway collection for the brand in September, formerly spent 12 years at the helm of LVMH’s Givenchy. He turned the faltering label into a fashion powerhouse favored by Beyonce and Madonna by selling intricate red-carpet couture alongside track suits and graphic tees that spearheaded the trend for luxury athletic-wear.
