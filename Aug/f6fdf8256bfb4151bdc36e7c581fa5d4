The World Health Organization said there are 75 confirmed cases and 27 probable cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There have been 59 deaths while 10 people have recovered from the disease and been discharged, WHO said in a post on Twitter on Thursday. It’s the second time the African nation has battled the hemorrhagic virus this year. This outbreak is in North Kivu province, a region in the northeast that’s home to more than one million displaced people. It shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda and has been wracked by violence committed by numerous militias, making it difficult for aid workers to try contain the outbreak.
