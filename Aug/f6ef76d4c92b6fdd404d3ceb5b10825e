Zimbabwe’s main opposition alliance will announce on Tuesday whether it plans to challenge last week’s general election results, spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda said. The Movement for Democratic Change’s legal team is gathering evidence “in terms of making sure the election isn’t stolen,” Sibanda told reporters on Monday in the capital, Harare. The MDC has alleged that the July 30 ballot was rigged and constituted “a coup against the will of the people.” Emmerson Mnangagwa was elected president in the vote, as his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party won a constitutional majority in parliament.
