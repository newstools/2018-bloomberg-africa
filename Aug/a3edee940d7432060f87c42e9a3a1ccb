European shares slid on Thursday while U.S. index futures edged higher after a mostly positive session in Asia that saw Chinese equities shrug off the tariff to-and-fro between Beijing and Washington. The dollar gained, while crude hovered near a seven-week low. Energy majors led the drop in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index as futures on the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones pointed to a slightly higher U.S. open. Chinese and Hong Kong stocks pushed firmer earlier as earnings reports offered a respite from the recent sell-off, while Japanese shares dropped. Treasuries were steady, and Italian bonds led gains for European debt. Emerging-market currencies weakened for a second day, with Turkey’s lira and Russia’s ruble extending their slump as disputes with the U.S. deepened. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and other countries are setting the tone for markets, with China responding to the Trump administration’s latest trade war volley with additional tariffs of its own. The ruble hit a two-year low after the U.S. announced new sanctions on Russia over the March 4 nerve-agent attack on a former double agent in the U.K. Turkey’s lira plunged to a record and bond yields climbed as a dispute over the detention of an American pastor dragged on. This is a modal window. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, discusses the impact of trade tensions on markets. Elsewhere, oil pared some of yesterday’s drop, though held near a seven-week low after China’s decision to slap 25 percent duties on U.S. imports including petroleum products. Most industrial metals gained and gold edged higher. Terminal users can follow our Markets Live blog here.
