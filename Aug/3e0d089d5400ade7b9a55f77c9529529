Zimbabwe’s ruling party asked the Constitutional Court to reject an opposition petition to overturn last month’s election result. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change alleges the July 30 vote won by incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa was rigged and that its candidate, Nelson Chamisa, was the rightful winner. The MDC has asked the court to overturn the result and hold a new election within 60 days. “We are more than confident there is no evidence of manipulation” of the election results, Lewis Uriri, Mnangagwa’s lawyer, told reporters Wednesday in the capital, Harare. “This is political gamesmanship.”
