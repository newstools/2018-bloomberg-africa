Zimbabwean opposition politician Tendai Biti, thwarted in a bid to seek asylum in Zambia, was charged with public violence in a court in his home country and released on bail. Biti, a former finance minister who had claimed Zimbabwe’s July 30 election was rigged, appeared Thursday in a lower court in the capital, Harare. It capped a dramatic 24 hours in which he’d tried to enter neighboring Zambia, was detained and eventually returned to Zimbabwean authorities. Prosecutors told the court Biti was charged with public violence after a riot in Harare on Aug. 2 caused $345,000 in damages. He also faces a charge of contravening Zimbabwe’s Electoral Act by announcing allegedly illegal or fabricated election results. The judge released Biti, 51, on $5,000 bail and ordered that he surrender his travel documents and report to police twice a day. The state didn’t oppose bail and no date for his trial was set.
