U.S. stock index futures pointed to a drop at the open and European equities fell following a downbeat session in Asia on Friday after President Donald Trump stepped up his tough talk on trade.

Emerging-market equities fell a second day, and the Indian rupee dropped to a record as contagion spread from Argentina and Turkey. The yen climbed and European sovereign bonds edged higher while the euro fell as the region’s inflation unexpectedly slowed.
