Londoners are buying more homes outside the capital as prices remain too high, even after the end of a decade-long housing boom. In the first half, Londoners bought more than 30,000 homes outside the city, a 16 percent rise from a year ago and 61 percent more than in the same period a decade earlier, according to research by Hamptons International. Nearly 40 percent of leavers relocated to the south east of England, followed by 30 percent who moved to the east of the country.

The surge in home values, which now cost the average Londoner a record 14.5 times their annual salary, mean that many city dwellers can no longer afford to buy. Stamp duty on a home worth 483,800 pounds ($621,500), the London average, is 9,190 pounds for first-time buyers and 14,190 pounds for those who have previously owned a property, according to the U.K. government’s website.
