Standard Chartered Plc restored its dividend after a two-year suspension and came close to analysts’ forecasts for revenue and profit, suggesting that Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters is gaining ground in getting the bank back on track. Bill Winters The lender’s shares rose as much as 3.3 percent in Hong Kong after it announced a full-year dividend of 11 cents per share and said it plans to increase payouts as its performance improves. The chief executive cited “the significant improvement in underlying profits, a strong capital position and emerging clarity on regulatory capital requirements” as allowing for dividends. “We are encouraged by our start to 2018,” he added in a statement. The bank said it started 2018 with broad-based double-digit year-on-year income growth Source: Company Filings  Winters, 56, spent his first three years cleaning up the balance sheet and culture of the firm after an explosion of emerging-market lending led to billions of dollars of bad loans, money-losing businesses and misconduct penalties. Now the CEO has to convince investors he can replace some of the $5 billion of revenue lost between 2012 and 2016. Revenue rose 2.6 percent to $14.4 billion last year, close to the average $14.5 billion estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and the first year-on-year rise since 2012. Underlying pretax profit for 2017 almost tripled to $3.01 billion, close to expectations for $3.1 billion. Winters cautioned that the bank still has a long way to go. “We are working hard to establish income growth momentum across all our businesses, and our return on equity continues to fall short of our cost of capital,” he said, adding that “this franchise is capable of much more.” Some key facts: Winters suspended the dividend in 2015 alongside a $5.1 billion capital raise from investors and a program to cut 15,000 jobs and restructure or exit $100 billion of risky assets.
