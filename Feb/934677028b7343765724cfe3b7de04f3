Mattel Inc.’s chief brands officer is stepping down as the struggling toymaker’s top two executives assume greater control over its biggest properties. Juliana Chugg will remain at the company for the time being as an adviser, a spokesman said. She joined the company in 2015 from General Mills Inc., where she ran its meals division with brands like Betty Crocker. Margo Georgiadis Chief Executive Officer Margo Georgiadis and Chief Operating Officer Richard Dickson will now assume more oversight, with the manager of American Girl reporting directly to the CEO. The leaders of other top brands, like Hot Wheels, Barbie and Fisher-Price will report directly to Dickson, the company said. “As part of our ongoing effort to transform Mattel into a high-performing toy company, Richard now has the right team in place,” spokesman Alex Clark said in a statement. Richard Dickson Dickson, who rejoined Mattel in 2014 after departing the company in 2010, has been tasked with reviving Mattel’s ailing brands. He’s had some success with Barbie and Hot Wheels. But the company has failed to turn its fortunes around, with its shares down 39 percent in the past 12 months. Georgiadis joined about a year ago, after a career running sales divisions at Google, and has since focused on creating growth for the company’s biggest brands while exiting several smaller toy lines.
