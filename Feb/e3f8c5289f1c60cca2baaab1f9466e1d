General Mills Inc. agreed to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc. for about $8 billion, adding the maker of natural dog and cat food to a portfolio that includes Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Cheerios cereal. The Minneapolis, Minnesota-based food company plans to pay $40 a share for Blue Buffalo, which sells “antioxidant-rich” dog nutrition and walnut-based kitty litter, the companies said in a statement Friday. The deal comes as global food giants are snapping up makers of natural and organic products, which are outpacing mainstream brands in growth. The Wilton, Connecticut-based pet food maker’s shares rose as much as 17 percent in premarket trading. Over the past three years, Blue Buffalo has delivered compound annual net sales growth of 12 percent, the company said. “In pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural and premium products,” General Mills Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said.
