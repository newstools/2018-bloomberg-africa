Improving labor rights in Mexico must be a central issue in reaching a new North American trade deal or the U.S. Congress won’t approve it, two Democratic lawmakers said on the eve of a new round of Nafta talks. Bill Pascrell “Labor rights in Mexico is not an issue that can be sidestepped," Reps. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey and Sandy Levin of Michigan said. "It is the central issue that must be addressed in any rewrite of Nafta. Failure by Mexico to stop suppressing its workers’ wages will not only be an obstacle for a new NAFTA, it will be a death knell for any deal passing Congress.” Levin and Pascrell seek to put labor issues front and center just as a new round of negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement begins on Sunday. It’s a view that, while coming from the minority party, may strike a chord with President Donald Trump, who has made better conditions for Mexican workers a requirement for revising the deal. A new bill in Mexico has been criticized by U.S. labor unions which say it would encourage more jobs to flee south of the border, and the lawmakers reference that bill in their statement. Their statement includes a letter signed January 23 by more than 180 members of Congress to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, saying that any new Nafta must have strong and binding provisions addressing Mexico’s labor conditions. It states that the current objectives in Nafta renegotiations don’t do "nearly enough" to address the problem. Sandy Levin Mexico’s new bill, which is scheduled for debate in the current congressional session, "would limit freedom of association and promote precarious work, likely driving Mexican wages even lower and encouraging further outsourcing of American and Canadian jobs," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka wrote in a letter addressed to Lighthizer and dated Dec. 12. Mexico’s labor ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours.
