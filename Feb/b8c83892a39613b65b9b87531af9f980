Provident Financial Plc settled one of its U.K. regulatory probes, which has hobbled the subprime lender since the summer of 2017. The shares posted their biggest gain in almost 29 years. The company said it will seek to raise around 300 million pounds ($419 million) in a rights offering to shore up its balance sheet and help pay a 172 million-pound Financial Conduct Authority settlement linked to its Vanquis Bank unit. A separate investigation at its auto-loans arm, which commenced in December, could take up to two years to conclude, according to Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Le May. Provident will use the funds to meet costs of U.K. regulatory investigations and ensure it has sufficient buffer over “increased regulatory capital requirements,” the Bradford, England-based company said Tuesday.  Its “turnaround is making progress, but the board and I realize there is still much to do to achieve a customer centric business delivering long-term sustainable returns to our shareholders,” Le May said. “It’s encouraging that a line has now been conclusively drawn under the FCA’s investigation,” said Portia Patel, London based analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd. The stock has fallen by almost 80 percent in the last 12 months before its open on Tuesday, as it struggled with a series of setbacks. Last summer, the firm botched the reorganization of its home credit unit, leading to a sharp falloff in debt collections and the departure of Chief Executive Officer Peter Crook. Provident also said it will pay no dividends for 2017 and aims to pay a nominal dividend for the 2018 financial year. Shares in Provident rose 32 percent to 774.40 pence at 8:22 a.m. in London trading. — With assistance by Edward Robinson
