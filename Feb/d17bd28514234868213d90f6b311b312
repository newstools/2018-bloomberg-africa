Indonesian President Joko Widodo nominated Perry Warjiyo to become the next governor of the country’s central bank, a person familiar with the matter said. Widodo, known as Jokowi, sent a letter to the parliament on Friday seeking approval for Warjiyo, now a deputy governor, to be installed as the next Bank Indonesia chief, replacing incumbent Agus Martowardojo whose five-year term ends in May, the person said. The parliament is required to conduct a fit-and-proper test and approve the appointment at least a month before the incumbent’s term ends. The letter is expected to be read out at the parliament’s next plenary session. Misbakhun, a lawmaker and member of financial commission, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, confirmed a letter had been received by the speaker of the parliament. He said the details of the letter and nomination remain confidential. Warjiyo’s nomination was first reported by Tempo, citing an unidentified source. Bank Indonesia spokesman Agusman, who also uses one name, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Johan Budi, a spokesman for the president, also didn’t respond to requests for comment. Warjiyo didn’t immediately reply to a text message seeking comment. Warjiyo will need to build on steps taken by Martowardojo to cool inflation, tame currency volatility and boost the central bank’s credibility with investors and credit rating firms. Indonesia’s central bank has cut interest rates eight times since the beginning of 2016 as it faced the challenge of accelerating economic growth that’s hovered around 5 percent since Jokowi took office in 2014. Warjiyo, 58, has been a deputy governor at Bank Indonesia since April 2013 and was set to complete his five-year term this year. With expertise in economic research and monetary policy, as well as international issues, he also held a two-year position as an executive director of the International Monetary Fund where he represented Asean nations. — With assistance by Rieka Rahadiana
