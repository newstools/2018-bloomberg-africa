Currency traders are finally catching a break after six years of job cuts thinned the ranks at the world’s biggest investment banks. Headcount rose 1.2 percent last year for front-office staff covering Group-of-10 foreign exchange, including sales and trading personnel, the first increase since at least 2010, according to Coalition Development Ltd. The gain was recorded even as revenues in those divisions plunged 21 percent, according to the provider of research and analytics for the financial industry.

That’s up from 2,438 in 2016, but still reflects a decline of 30 percent since 2010. Revenues sank to $7.1 billion last year from $9 billion a year earlier. FX options markets were a particular laggard, Shahani said. The 12 banks in Coalition’s analysis included: Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale SA and UBS Group AG. Banks have slashed foreign-exchange jobs in recent years amid automation and stricter regulation, but the current staffing levels could represent a trough for staffing levels, Shahani said. Dealers still need to maintain operations across all FX products in order to keep key customers, including large asset managers and hedge funds, he said. Banks are saying “we have to keep the lights on,” Shahani said.
