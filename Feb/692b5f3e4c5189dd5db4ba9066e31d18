Global stocks took another leg down on Thursday in the wake of Federal Reserve minutes that painted a healthy picture of the world’s biggest economy, raising the prospect of tighter monetary policy. U.S. futures managed to reverse a decline, however, while the dollar edged lower as Treasuries rose. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid as almost all the major national equity gauges in the region fell. Earlier in Asia most shares retreated, though China’s market bucked the trend as it reopened after a holiday. The Treasury move pared some of Wednesday’s slide following the minutes from the Fed’s January meeting, which showed increasing confidence growth will pick up despite concerns around inflation. “The market is pricing in the possibility of a tighter Fed over time,” Evan Brown, director at UBS Asset Management, who previously worked on the open market trading desk at the New York Fed, told Bloomberg TV in New York. On a day-to-day basis “you’re going to see volatility, you’re going to see equities get a little skittish when yields are rising, but as you look over the long term, fundamentals on the economy are very strong,” he said. For now, markets remain fragile. February is shaping up as one of the worst months for global equities in more than a year as concerns about a pick-up in inflation and expensive stock prices outweigh evidence of a buoyant U.S. economy. With recent data underpinning the view that inflation is no longer lagging, the OIS space shows traders pricing in just shy of three U.S. rate hikes over the next 12 months. Elsewhere, gold retreated alongside most commodities. The pound was weaker as data showed the U.K. economy expanded less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter.
