The Bank of Korea left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in Governor Lee Ju-yeol’s last policy meeting. With the Federal Reserve expected to hike rates three times this year, the decision to keep the seven-day repurchase rate at 1.5 percent paves the way for the U.S. benchmark rate to push past Korea’s and make South Korean assets less attractive. This doesn’t mean the BOK needs to respond automatically to the Fed’s policy changes, Lee said. Even if the benchmark interest rate falls below the Fed’s, the central bank doesn’t expect large capital outflows, according to Governor Lee.
