About 50,000 ounces -- or about 125 gold bars -- is all that stood in the way of Newmont Mining Corp. claiming the title of world’s biggest bullion producer. The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based miner said Thursday its 2017 gold production was 5.27 million ounces, ending the year in a near dead-heat with industry leader Barrick Gold Corp., which produced 5.32 million ounces. However, Newmont reiterated its outlook that exceeds Barrick’s forecasted output for the next four years. Goldberg has increasingly highlighted his company’s growth prospects to investors, as well as Newmont’s commitment to lure investors away from ETFs with high dividends. On Tuesday, the miner almost doubled its quarterly payout to 14 cents a share. That has helped Newmont vault ahead of Toronto-based Barrick by market share, but not output. Newmont produced more gold than Barrick in the second half of 2017, but not enough to result in a full-year beat. Newmont’s fourth-quarter production was 1.34 million, matching Barrick’s output. Newmont scheduled a conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings at 10 a.m. in New York. North American investors should call +1-855-209-8210; international callers +1-412-317-5213. Barrick scheduled an investor day in New York at 2-5 p.m. The company is expected to provide more information about its existing and brownfield pipeline and provide guidance beyond 2022. Callers can dial +1-800-319-4610 in North America and +1-416-915-3239 elsewhere. — With assistance by Luzi-Ann Javier
