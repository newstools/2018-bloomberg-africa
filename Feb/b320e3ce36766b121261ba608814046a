IQiyi Inc., the Chinese entertainment company backed by Baidu Inc., filed for an initial public offering in the U.S. The Beijing-based company filed with an offering size of $1.5 billion, an initial placeholder amount that is likely to change, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. IQiyi is aiming for a public market valuation of as much as $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said last year. IQiyi, whose streaming-video service is similar to American rival Netflix Inc., had 50.8 million subscribers at the end of 2017, according to the filing. The company posted a net loss of $574 million on total revenue of $2.7 billion last year. IQiyi’s move toward public markets follows a blockbuster year for Chinese companies listing in the U.S. Twenty-one businesses went public on American exchanges in 2017 to raise a combined $3.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most since 2010, when 40 Chinese companies raised a total of $4 billion. The company plans to offer Class A shares to the public, while Baidu will hold all of the company’s Class B shares, the filing shows. Baidu currently holds 70 percent of iQiyi’s shares. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corp. are leading the IPO. The company has applied to list its American depository shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker IQ.
