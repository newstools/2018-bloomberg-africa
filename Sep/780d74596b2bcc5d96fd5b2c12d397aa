Malta has edged out Hong Kong to take the prize for territory or country with the highest residential price gains in the June quarter, according to a Knight Frank LLP Global House Price Index published Friday. Home prices in the tiny Mediterranean island rose 17 percent in the three months to June from a year earlier, Knight Frank said, citing data from the nation’s central bank.
